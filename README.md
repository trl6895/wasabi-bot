## Requirements (Editing):

    - discord.js
    - dotenv

  In-depth written guide of discord.js: https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/command-deployment.html#guild-commands
  
## Purpose
The idea of this bot is to ideally be a music player for my (Triston's) own selection of music.
It would be able to grab music from the selection on Youtube and play it in a discord voice channel.
Unsure of how it would be implemented, but probably would grab a video off of one of my Youtube playlists.
Optimally, this bot could:
  - Shuffle play the whole playlist
  - Have sub-playlists sorted by genre
  - Recommend a randomly-chosen SOTD (song of the day)
  
 Not sure if any or all of this is feasible, considering I've never made a discord bot lol
